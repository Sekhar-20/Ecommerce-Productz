# eCommerce Website

I took a template from Webtheme and developed it into a Productz e-commerce website.

In this project, I demonstrated in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

I added my own created pages (Men, Women, Products, or Shop Now) that are linked to the navbar menu headers.

I created a sign in page linked to the user icon in the navbar menu.

I have created banner and logo or favicon using canva.

I have edited and added every photo on this website.
